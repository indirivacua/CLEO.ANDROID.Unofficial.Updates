#### Updated Version IDs (called by CLEO opcode 0DD6):

|   Game  | ID |
| ------- | -- |
| III 1.8 |  1 |
| III 1.6 | 11 |
| VC 1.09 |  2 |
| VC 1.07 | 12 |

(Due to space limitations, I can't add new IDs. Instead, the new versions replace the IDs from the oldest versions, III 1.4 & VC 1.03)

#### Obfuscation in new game libraries:
In the updated game libraries (libGTAxx.so), some existing export functions are no longer called by the game (i.e. "uses police radio" in GTA3 1.8). I haven't looked too in-depth yet but I assume it means the function has been recreated elsewhere without an "export" label, and probably wrapped into some other process, to make it harder to find. 


#### CLEO Android Opcodes
If you don't have them already here are all the CLEO Android opcodes. Copy & paste these into your SannyBuilder opcodes to compile Android scripts:
```
0DD0=2,%1d% = get_label_addr%2p%; Android
0DD1=2,%1d% = get_func_addr_by_cstr_name%2d%; Android
0DD2=1,context_call_func%1d%; Android
0DD3=2,context_set_reg%1d% value%2d%; Android
0DD4=2,%1d% = context_get_reg%2d%; Android
0DD6=1,%1d% = get_game_version; Android
0DD7=1,%1d% = get_image_base; Android
0DD8=4,%1d% = read_mem_addr%2d% size%3d% add_ib%4d%; Android
0DD9=5,write_mem_addr%1d% value%2d% size%3d% add_ib%4d% protect%5d%; Android
0DDC=2,set_mutex_var%1d% to%2d%; Android
0DDD=2,%1d% = get_mutex_var%2d%; Android
0DE0=3,%1d% = get_touch_point_state%2d% mintime%3d%; Android
0DE1=5,%1d% = get_touch_slide_state from%2d% to%3d% mintime%4d% maxtime%5d%; Android
0DE2=1,%1d% = get_menu_button_state; read opcode info before using; Android
0DE3=2,%1d% = get_menu_button_pressed mintime%2d%; read opcode info before using; Android
```
