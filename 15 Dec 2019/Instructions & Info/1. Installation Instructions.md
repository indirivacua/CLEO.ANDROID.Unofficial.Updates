### Installation instructions (Non-root Android 7+):

1. Copy the game APK off your phone with an app like FX File Manager, and transfer it to your PC.
 
2. Install [APK Easy Tool](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/tool-apk-easy-tool-v1-02-windows-gui-t3333960) on your PC, and decompile the APK.

3. Open the decompiled APK folder, and bring up the files from this download next to it. Now:
   - Copy libCLEO.so to [apk]/lib/armeabi-v7a/.
   - Copy the "smali" folder (from 'classes.dex patches') and **overwrite** [apk]/smali

4. Rename the folder to GTA CLEO or whatever you want, and compile it.

5. Move the new APK back to your phone and install*.
   - **NOTE:** If you're not upgrading from an older version, you will have to uninstall the game before installing the CLEO version. Just rename the directories before uninstall, and they wont be deleted. Rename back afterwards.
